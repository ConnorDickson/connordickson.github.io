title: Change of mind. Learning F#

Why? Also, where to start with functional programming?

# Update on goals

If you read any of my previous posts they were about starting to learn Go. This is still a goal of mine but after some chats with co-workers I decided that learning a new type of development beyond [Oject Orientated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) so I am putting a pause on my Go education and learning a [Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) language as I think this will improve my ability to solve problems as I can reason with them from a different angle.

I had debated deleting my old Go posts and starting fresh but I feel like this gives a good insight into how goals can change frequently and you have to constantly revisit them, be open to change and be able to adapt quickly.

## Where to start with F#?

Luckily the [F# website](https://fsharp.org/learn.html) has links for where to start with learning. So I picked the link that said [F# for C# devs](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/) as I feel I fit the criteria there.

The first thing to learn is how to "think functionally" which I think will be interesting, F# will just be a tool that enabled me to do so, so that's the real objective. In doing so it will allow me to write effective F# code to solve problems.

Step one is to get me up and running with F# development. There is an [installation guide](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/installing-and-using/) on their website which is helpful.

I installed Ionide-fsharp extension within VS-Code in order to do my development and installed the other tools required for development on windows.

Next was [why use F#?](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/why-use-fsharp/). This is just me working down the "Getting stared" section of the F# Website linked above.

## Next steps

I created a repository [here](https://github.com/ConnorDickson/LearningF-) where I have added in some Interactive Examples.

The next steps according to the [https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com) website is to follow through the whole of the ["Why use F#"](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/why-use-fsharp-intro/) documentation of which there are 30 pages. So it seems like I will be doing a lot of research before I get to develop any code. This is alongside other programming reading I have set myself. There is plenty out there to learn, I just need to be sensible in what I choose.

My goals are currently;

1. Learn C# in depth
2. Begin learning F#
3. Learn Go

## Concerns

I wanted to check if it would be possible to use F# with dotnet core and [it is!](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/get-started-command-line). This makes it more appealing as I can write cross platform applications with it!

What if I want to use this language to solve a problem and then somebody else comes along who doesn't know F# and can't understand it? So even though this might be the correct tool it might make it less appealing. There will have to be a strong argument to use this to execute logic over regular C# and the barrier to entry of learning F# will have to be quite low, or at least easy enough to understand what might be going wrong
