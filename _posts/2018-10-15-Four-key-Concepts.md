title: F# - Four Key Concepts/future plans
---

The concepts that differenciate F# from a standard imperative language

Original post [here](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/key-concepts/) 

# 5 C's

Conciseness, convenience, correctness, concurrency and completeness. Sounds like a good collection of words

# Differences that are important to understand

1) Function-orientated
2) Expressions
3) Algebraic types
4) Pattern matching

At the moment I'm not confident in any of these concepts apart from Function-orientated

I feel like writing this up for my benefit is getting in the way of me learning as it slows me down. I aspire to get to the point where I can write my own solution and implement business logic using F# confortably. So for now, I'm going to focus on adding to the development [repo](https://github.com/ConnorDickson/LearningF-) until I'm confident enough to branch out and add something of value to these blog posts rather than just regurgitating what is already in the tutorial
