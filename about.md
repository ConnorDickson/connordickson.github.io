My name is Connor Dickson and I'm a Software Engineer working in Belfast.

My knowledge is specialised around Azure, VSTS and .NET but I have a keen interest in learning new things.

As some background around myself, in the past I have;
* Spent a lot of time working with different components in Microsoft Azure and expanding my knowledge through a combination of reading articles and hands on experience
* Worked on securing a cloud based application to a very high standard
* Developed, deployed and reasoned with multiple Node.js applications using Docker Swarm running on a cluster of Raspberry Pi's
* Written multiple detailed SharePoint solutions where I was entrusted with design and implementation details
* Setup an automated CI/CD pipeline while working closely with a team to smoothly deliver a product, this means having a dedication to the software delivery process as a whole from development to testing to production
* Been involved in all aspects of the business which includes working directly with customers to deliver software that solves their problems
* Presented a talk around the topic of the importance of work experience and another about securing data in the Cloud
