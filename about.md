My name is Connor Dickson and I'm a Software Engineer working in Belfast

My knowledge is specialised around Azure, VSTS and .NET but I have a keen interest in learning new things.

As some background around myself, in the past I have;
* Worked on securing a Cloud based Application to a high standard
* Developed, deployed and reasoned with multiple Node.js applications using Docker Swarm running on a cluster of Raspberry Pi's
* Written multiple SharePoint solutions where I was entrusted with design and implementation details
* Setup an automated CI/CD pipeline while working closely with a team to smoothly deliver a product
* Worked with customers to deliver software that solves their problems
* Presented a talk around the topic of work experience and another about securing data in the Cloud
